Basics about types of SSDS:

SATA SSDs are cheaper but are limited to the max speed of the SATA standard, that being 550MB/s. Although that is way faster than
an HDD, it is still limited by the SATA format.

M.2 SSDs are the solution for this, the only issue being, it is only usable on modern hardware. M.2 SSDs came around in early 2015, when Windows 10 first
released. This means that any computer released before 2015, may not support M.2. Most if not all of modern hardware however, supports M.2, so if your computer is from 2015-Present, you should be able to upgrade to an M.2 SSD.

Only go for a SATA SSD, if you have a low budget, or you have older hardware.

If you have newer hardware and you're willing to spend a bit more, I would highly recommend M.2 SSDs. They use the PCIE bus, which is extremely fast, giving you its fast benefits for faster booting and faster loading times.

Once you choose which type you wish to have, I will show you many types of your preferred SSD type, choose which one you wish from the ones I will show you, then the price will be.

The price of the SSD+An installation fee of 30 dollars.
